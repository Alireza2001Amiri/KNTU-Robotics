	\section{Introduction}
	Tensors are mathematical objects that generalize scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions. They are widely used in physics, engineering, and machine learning.
	
	\section{Historical Background}
	Tensors originated in the 19th century, with significant contributions from Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita. Einstein's general relativity formalized tensor calculus in the early 20th century, highlighting its importance in physics.
	
	\section{Tensor Structure}
	Tensors can be represented as multidimensional arrays, with rank defining the number of indices required. For example:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Scalars (rank 0): $T$
		\item Vectors (rank 1): $T_i$
		\item Matrices (rank 2): $T_{ij}$
		\item Higher-order tensors (rank 3 and above): $T_{ijk}$
	\end{itemize}
	A rank-$n$ tensor follows transformation rules under coordinate changes:
	\begin{equation}
		T'^{i_1 i_2 \dots i_n} = \sum_{j_1 j_2 \dots j_n} \Lambda^{i_1}_{j_1} \Lambda^{i_2}_{j_2} \dots \Lambda^{i_n}_{j_n} T^{j_1 j_2 \dots j_n}
	\end{equation}
	where $\Lambda$ represents the transformation matrix.

	
	\section{Comparison with Matrices}
	\subsection{Definition and Structure}
	A matrix is a 2D array, while tensors extend to any number of dimensions.
	
	\subsection{Operations}
	Matrix operations include addition, multiplication, and inversion. Tensor operations generalize these concepts, including tensor contraction and outer products.
	
	\subsection{Applications}
	Matrices are fundamental in linear algebra, while tensors are essential in physics, machine learning, and deep learning frameworks.
	
	\subsection{Similarities and Differences}
	Tensors generalize matrices, allowing representation of multi-dimensional data. Matrices, however, are limited to two dimensions.
	
	\section{Usage of Tensors}
	\subsection{Applications in Engineering}
	Tensors describe physical properties such as stress and strain in material science and fluid mechanics. The stress tensor is given by:
	\begin{equation}
		\sigma_{ij} = \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_j}
	\end{equation}
	where $F_i$ represents the force components and $x_j$ are the spatial coordinates.
	
	\subsection{Tensors in Physics}
	Tensors model quantities like angular momentum, electromagnetism, and Einstein's field equations. The Einstein field equation is written as:
	\begin{equation}
		G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
	\end{equation}
	where $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor and $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor.
	
	\subsection{Applications in Machine Learning}
	Tensors are fundamental in deep learning for data representation and transformations in neural networks.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	Tensors provide a comprehensive framework for multi-dimensional data representation, extending the capabilities of matrices. Their applications span physics, engineering, and modern artificial intelligence.
